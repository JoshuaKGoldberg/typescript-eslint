:::danger Deprecated

This rule has been deprecated because the base [`init-declarations`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/init-declarations) rule added support for TypeScript syntax.
There is no longer any need to use this extension rule.
It will be removed in the next major version of typescript-eslint.

:::

It adds support for TypeScript's `declare` variables.
