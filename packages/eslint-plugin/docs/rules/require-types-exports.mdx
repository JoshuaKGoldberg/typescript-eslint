When exporting entities from a file, it is often useful to export also all the types that are used in their declarations.
Doing so ensures consumers of the file can directly import and use those types when using those entities.

Otherwise, consumers may have to use utility types like [`Parameters`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#parameterstype) or [`ReturnType`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#returntypetype) in order to extract the types from the entities.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
type Arg = string;
type Result = number;

export function strLength(arg: Arg): Result {
  return arg.length;
}
```

```ts
interface Fruit {
  name: string;
  color: string;
}

export const getFruitName = (fruit: Fruit) => fruit.name;
```

```ts
enum Color {
  Red = 'red',
  Green = 'green',
  Blue = 'blue',
}

export declare function getRandomColor(): Color;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
export type Arg = string;
export type Result = number;

export function strLength(arg: Arg): Result {
  return arg.length;
}
```

```ts
export interface Fruit {
  name: string;
  color: string;
}

export const getFruitName = (fruit: Fruit) => fruit.name;
```

```ts
export enum Color {
  Red = 'red',
  Green = 'green',
  Blue = 'blue',
}

export declare function getRandomColor(): Color;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## When Not To Use It

If your files utilize many complex self-referential types that you don't want external consumers to reference, you may want to avoid this rule for those cases.
You might consider using [ESLint disable comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.
