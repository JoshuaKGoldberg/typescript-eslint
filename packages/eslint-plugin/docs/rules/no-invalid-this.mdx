:::danger Deprecated

This rule has been deprecated because the base [`no-invalid-this`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-invalid-this) rule added support for TypeScript syntax.
There is no longer any need to use this extension rule.
It will be removed in the next major version of typescript-eslint.

:::

It adds support for TypeScript's `this` parameters.
