## General Questions

### How can I ban `<specific language feature>`?

ESLint core contains the rule [`no-restricted-syntax`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-syntax).
This generic rule allows you to specify a [selector](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/selectors) for the code you want to ban, along with a custom error message.

You can use an AST visualization tool such as [typescript-eslint playground](/play#showAST=es) > _Options_ > _AST Explorer_ on its left sidebar by selecting _ESTree_ to help in figuring out the structure of the AST that you want to ban.

For example, you can ban enums (or some variation of) using one of the following configs:

```jsonc
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-syntax": [
      "error",
      // ban all enums
      {
        "selector": "TSEnumDeclaration",
        "message": "My reason for not using any enums at all",
      },

      // ban just const enums
      {
        "selector": "TSEnumDeclaration[const=true]",
        "message": "My reason for not using const enums",
      },

      // ban just non-const enums
      {
        "selector": "TSEnumDeclaration:not([const=true])",
        "message": "My reason for not using non-const enums",
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### How do I check to see what versions are installed?

If you have multiple versions of our tooling, it can cause various bugs for you.
This is because ESLint may load a different version each run depending on how you run it - leading to inconsistent lint results.

Installing our tooling in the root of your project does not mean that only one version is installed.
One or more of your dependencies may have its own dependency on our tooling, meaning `npm`/`yarn` will additionally install that version for use by that package.
For example, `react-scripts` (part of `create-react-app`) has a dependency on our tooling.

You can check what versions are installed in your project using the following commands:

```bash npm2yarn
npm list @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
```

If you see more than one version installed, then you will have to either use [yarn resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions) to force a single version, or you will have to downgrade your root versions to match the dependency versions.

**The best course of action in this case is to wait until your dependency releases a new version with support for our latest versions.**

### Changes to one file are not reflected when linting other files in my IDE

> tl;dr: Restart your ESLint server to force an update.

ESLint currently does not have any way of telling parsers such as ours when an arbitrary file is changed on disk.
That means if you change file A that is imported by file B, it won't update lint caches for file B -- even if file B's text contents have changed.
Sometimes the only solution is to restart your ESLint editor extension altogether.

See [this issue comment](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/5845#issuecomment-1283248238 'GitHub issue 5845, comment 1283248238: details on ESLint cross-file caching') for more information.

[VS Code's ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) provides an `ESLint: Restart ESLint Server` action.

#### I get `no-unsafe-*` complaints for cross-file changes

See [Changes to one file are not reflected in linting other files in my IDE](#changes-to-one-file-are-not-reflected-when-linting-other-files-in-my-ide).
Rules such as [`no-unsafe-argument`](/rules/no-unsafe-argument), [`no-unsafe-assignment`](/rules/no-unsafe-assignment), and [`no-unsafe-call`](/rules/no-unsafe-call) are often impacted.

### "The '`<key>`' property is deprecated on '`<type>`' nodes. Use '`<key>`' instead." warnings

If you're seeing this warning, it's likely you're using an ESLint plugin (or other tooling) that hasn't been updated for typescript-eslint v6.
Make sure you're using the latest versions of each of your ESLint plugins (and other tooling).

If you've using many ESLint plugins, have updated each to their latest version, and you're not sure which one this complaint is coming from, try either or both of:

- Running with [`--trace-deprecation`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--trace-deprecation) (e.g. `npx cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--trace-deprecation npm run lint`)
- Disabling half of them at a time to narrow down which plugin it is

Then make sure each of those plugins has a GitHub issue asking that they release a version supporting typescript-eslint v6.

:::tip
For developers updating ESLint rules in plugins that still need to support typescript-eslint v5: you may need to `||` fall back to the old property key if the new one doesn't exist:

```diff
- node.typeParameters
+ node.typeArguments || node.typeParameters
```

:::

For more context, see the [Some properties named typeParameters instead of typeArguments](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/146) issue, and the implementing [fix: rename typeParameters to typeArguments where needed](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/5384) pull request.

The [typescript-eslint v6 release post](/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v6-beta) has more information on typescript-eslint v6.

## ESLint

### Why is a rule from ESLint core not working correctly with TypeScript code?

This happens because TypeScript adds new features that ESLint doesn't know about.

The first step is to [check our list of "extension" rules here](/rules/#extension-rules).
An extension rule is a rule which extends the base ESLint rules to support TypeScript syntax.
If you find it in there, give it a go to see if it works for you.
You can configure it by disabling the base rule, and turning on the extension rule.
Here's an example with the `semi` rule:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "semi": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/semi": "error"
  }
}
```

If you don't find an existing extension rule, or the extension rule doesn't work for your case, then you can go ahead and check our issues.
[The contributing guide outlines the best way to raise an issue](../contributing/Issues.mdx).

> We release a new version our tooling every week.
> _Please_ ensure that you [check our the latest list of "extension" rules](/rules/#extension-rules) **_before_** filing an issue.

### I get errors from the `no-undef` rule about global variables not being defined, even though there are no TypeScript errors

The `no-undef` lint rule does not use TypeScript to determine the global variables that exist - instead, it relies upon ESLint's configuration.

We strongly recommend that you do not use the `no-undef` lint rule on TypeScript projects.
The checks it provides are already provided by TypeScript without the need for configuration - TypeScript just does this significantly better.

As of our v4.0.0 release, this also applies to types.
If you use global types from a 3rd party package (i.e. anything from an `@types` package), then you will have to configure ESLint appropriately to define these global types.
For example; the `JSX` namespace from `@types/react` is a global 3rd party type that you must define in your ESLint config.

Note, that for a mixed project including JavaScript and TypeScript, the `no-undef` rule (like any rule) can be turned off for TypeScript files alone as follows:

<Tabs groupId="eslint-config">
<TabItem value="Flat Config">

```js title="eslint.config.js"
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';

export default tseslint.config(
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts}'],
    rules: {
      'no-undef': 'off',
    },
  },
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Config">

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['*.ts', '*.mts', '*.cts', '*.tsx'],
      rules: {
        'no-undef': 'off',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you choose to leave on the ESLint `no-undef` lint rule, you can [manually define the set of allowed `globals` in your ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-globals), and/or you can use one of the [pre-defined environment (`env`) configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-environments).

### Can I use ESLint's `--cache` with typescript-eslint?

[ESLint's `--cache` option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#caching) caches on a per-file basis.
You can use it, but it will only work reliably for untyped rules -- and even then, not always.

Any ESLint rule that checks logic across files, including many rules from `eslint-plugin-import`, creates cross-file dependencies.
[Typed lint rules](../getting-started/Typed_Linting.mdx) almost always have dependencies on types across files in practice.
ESLint's caching doesn't account for those cross-file dependencies.

We don't recommend using `--cache`.

## TypeScript

### Should TypeScript should be installed globally or locally?

Make sure that you have installed TypeScript locally i.e. by using `npm install typescript`, not `npm install -g typescript`,
or by using `yarn add typescript`, not `yarn global add typescript`.
See [#2041](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/2041) for more information.

### Why don't I see TypeScript errors in my ESLint output?

TypeScript's compiler (or whatever your build chain may be) is specifically designed and built to validate the correctness of your codebase.
Our tooling does not reproduce the errors that TypeScript provides, because doing so would slow down the lint run [1], and duplicate the errors that TypeScript already outputs for you.

Instead, our tooling exists to **_augment_** TypeScript's built in checks with lint rules that consume the type information in new ways beyond just verifying the runtime correctness of your code.

[1] - TypeScript computes type information lazily, so us asking for the errors it would produce from the compiler would take an _additional_ ~100ms per file.
This doesn't sound like a lot, but depending on the size of your codebase, it can easily add up to between several seconds to several minutes to a lint run.

### How can I specify a TypeScript version / `parserOptions.typescriptLocation`?

You can't, and you don't want to.

You should use the same version of TypeScript for linting as the rest of your project.
TypeScript versions often have slight differences in edge cases that can cause contradictory information between typescript-eslint rules and editor information.
For example:

- `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions` might be operating with TypeScript version _X_ and think a variable is `string[] | undefined`
- TypeScript itself might be on version _X+1-beta_ and think the variable is `string[]`

See [this issue comment](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/4102#issuecomment-963265514) for more details.

## Vue & Other Frameworks

## I use a framework (like Vue) that requires custom file extensions, and I get errors like "You should add `parserOptions.extraFileExtensions` to your config"

You can use `parserOptions.extraFileExtensions` to specify an array of non-TypeScript extensions to allow, for example:

<Tabs groupId="eslint-config">
<TabItem value="Flat Config">

```js title="eslint.config.js"
export default tseslint.config(
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  {
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
        project: ['./tsconfig.json'],
        // Add this line
        extraFileExtensions: ['.vue'],
      },
    },
  },
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Config">

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  parserOptions: {
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
    project: ['./tsconfig.json'],
    // Add this line
    extraFileExtensions: ['.vue'],
  },
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## I am running into errors when parsing TypeScript in my .vue files

If you are running into issues parsing .vue files, it might be because parsers like [`vue-eslint-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-eslint-parser) are required to parse `.vue` files. In this case you can move `@typescript-eslint/parser` inside `parserOptions` and use `vue-eslint-parser` as the top level parser.

<Tabs groupId="eslint-config">
<TabItem value="Flat Config">

```js title="eslint.config.js"
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';
// Add this line
import vueParser from 'vue-eslint-parser';

export default tseslint.config(
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  {
    languageOptions: {
      // Remove this line
      parser: tseslint.parser,
      // Add this line
      parser: vueParser,
      parserOptions: {
        // Add this line
        parser: tseslint.parser,
        sourceType: 'module',
      },
    },
  },
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Config">

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  // Remove this line
  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
  // Add this line
  parser: 'vue-eslint-parser',
  parserOptions: {
    parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
    // Add this line
    extraFileExtensions: ['.vue'],
  },
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `parserOptions.parser` option can also specify an object to specify multiple parsers. See the [`vue-eslint-parser` usage guide](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/#usage) for more details.
